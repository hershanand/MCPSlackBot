## üìñ Summary
This bot was created to pull in a user's attributes, segment membership, engagement score and NBA/NBO from Marketing Cloud Personalization into Slack.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites
* Heroku
* Slack
* Marketing Cloud Personalization - Premium Edition
* MCP Promotion Library Setup (minimum of **name, image, and description** should be present)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è 1. Create Server-Side Template & Campaign, Generate API Keys
1. You‚Äôll need to create 2 server-side templates:
  1. First template should return the list of promotions (reference our [Einstein Decisions template](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/sales-service-cloud-connector-einstein-decisions.html)).
  2. Second template should return the user‚Äôs attributes (reference the following [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aaronrileysalesforce/ServerSideTemplates/blob/main/RetrieveAttributes)).
2. Next you‚Äôll create a server-side campaign, one for each of the templates. Attach each template to their respective campaign.
    1. For the promotions campaign, set the asset content zone and a value for the datafield.
    2. For the user attribute campaign, set the value to retrieve as **profileId**.
    3. Save and publish both campaigns.
3. Navigate to **Security ‚Üí API Tokens** and select the **Generate Token button** to create the API Keys (we will use this later in Heroku).

## üß¨ 2. Configure MCP Slack Bot
1. Clone this GitHub repo and open the **config.yaml** file.
    1. Edit **lines 5-10** with your MCP instance information: account & dataset name, datafield values, server-side campaign names. The **datafield** attributes were set in your server-side template code. Reference the config file below as an example:

2. Create a new app within Heroku and deploy the cloned repo with your modified YAML file.
3. Within the app, navigate to **Settings** and select **Reveal Config Vars button**. Add the following API values you obtained from MCP in Step 1.3 and label them the following:
    1. API_KEY
    2. API_SECRET

## ‚ú® 3. Create MCP Slack Bot
1. Login to your Slack instance and navigate to [your apps section](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Create New App button**.
    1. Select the **From an app manifest** option
    2. Select the workspace the app should be deployed
    3. From the YAML code below, replace the **<HEROKU_VALUE>** (lines 11 and 23) with your Heroku app domain. This value can be obtained within **Heroku Settings** and under the **Domains** section. Then copy and paste the code to your manifest and create the app.

## ‚ùì FAQs
<details><summary>Do I need to follow the setup instructions in order?</summary>
<br>
It is not required that you set up the bot in order. You may go out of order if you would like.</details>
<details markdown="1"><summary>I am receiving the following error "/einstein failed with the error "dispatch_failed"</summary>
<br>
Double check the following:
<ol><li>All config vars in Heroku have the correct key name and corresponding value. These are case-sensitive.</li>
<li>Check the Heroku domain name within your Slack YAML is correct. It should be your <b>unique app name</b> with an <i>identifier value</i> generated by Heroku, i.e. https://<b>example-app</b>-<i>1234567890ab</i>.herokuapp.com/</li></ol></details>
<details markdown="1"><summary>Do I need Heroku to deploy the bot?</summary>
<br>
Currently, the script for the bot needs to be hosted on a server. While this setup uses Heroku to walk through the deployment, it is not mandatory you use it. The script can be deployed on any server, i.e. AWS, GCP. If you decide not to use Heroku, you will need to set up the enviroment variables within the given server of choice and obtain the hosted URL to set up the Slack YAML configuration.</details>
